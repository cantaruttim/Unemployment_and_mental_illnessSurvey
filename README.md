# Unemployment_and_mental_illnessSurvey

## Context (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelacorley/unemployment-and-mental-illness-survey?resource=download)

This is a paid research survey to explore the linkage between mental illness and unemployment. NAMI has conducted multiple surveys verifying the high unemployment rate among those with mental illness, but this is the only survey to date which targets causation (why they are unemployed). Statistical significance of the variance has long since been proven by previous, larger samples.
